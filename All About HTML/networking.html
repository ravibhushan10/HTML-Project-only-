        <h2>What is the internet?</h2>
        <p>
          It is a medium to communicate with multiple other devices. Like we are
          sending the data form the one computer to another computer or sending
          the data from phone to computer and accessing the website.The internet
          is a vast, global network of interconnected computer networks that
          allows for the exchange of data. It's often called a "network of
          networks" because it links millions of computers, devices, and
          networks worldwide using a standardized set of rules known as
          protocols.

        <h3>How is data transferred?</h3>
        <p>
          To send the data from one device to another device we need the exact
          location of that device otherwise data goes to anyone. To finding the
          exact location of device come the concept of IP Address where each
          device gets unique IP Address when they connected to internet then
          sender device make a packet and write the IP of reciver device and own
          IP and send the packet to internet then packet goes through the router
          and recive to reciever end .

        <h2>IP Address:</h2>

        <p>
          An IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)address is the classic IP address
          format everyone is used to seeing.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Structure:</b>It's a 32-bit number. To make it readable for
              humans, we divide it into four 8-bit sections, and write each
              section as a decimal number from 0 to 255.
            </p>
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><b>Example:</b>172.217.16.142 (one of Google's addresses)</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>The Big Problem (The Why):</b>A 32-bit number means there's a
              hard limit on the total number of possible addresses: 2^32, which
              is about 4.3 billion.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When the internet was designed, 4.3 billion seemed like an infinite
          number. But with the explosion of laptops, phones, servers, smart
          watches, and even smart refrigerators, we quickly realized we would
          run out. This scarcity is the single most important reason we have
          public and private IPs.

        <h2>Public IP Address:</h2>
        <p>
          A Public IP address is your global, unique address on the internet.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><b>Analogy:</b>The company's main, public phone number.</p>

          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Uniqueness: </b>It must be globally unique. No two devices on
              the internet can have the same public IP address at the same time.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Purpose: </b>To be reachable from anywhere in the world. This
              is the address that web servers, email servers, and any other
              public service use.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Assignment:</b> It is assigned to you by your Internet Service
              Provider (ISP) (Comcast, AT&T, etc.). You don't control it; you
              lease it from them.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Who has one?</b>Your home router has one. The server
              hosting google.com has one. The server hosting Netflix has one.

      <!-- private ip -->

      <div>
        <h2>Private IP Address:</h2>
        <p>
          A Private IP address is a local address used only within your own
          private network (e.g., your home Wi-Fi, your office network).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Analogy: </b>: The employee's private, 4-digit extension
              number.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Uniqueness:</b> It only needs to be unique on your local
              network. My laptop can have the address 192.168.1.100 on my home
              Wi-Fi, and your laptop can have the exact same address on your
              home Wi-Fi. They don't conflict because they are in separate,
              private networks.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Purpose: </b>To allow devices on the same local network to
              communicate with each other without needing a globally unique
              address for each one. Your laptop talks to your printer using
              private IPs. Your phone streams to your Chromecast using private
              IPs.

          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Reserved Ranges:</b>The internet authorities have reserved
              specific ranges of addresses just for this purpose. If you see an
              IP address starting with one of these, you know it's a private
              address:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (Used by large corporations)</li>
              <li>
                172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (Used by medium-sized networks)
              </li>
              <li>
                192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (Most common for home networks)
              </li>

      <!-- DNS -->
      <div>
        <h2>DNS(DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM)</h2>
        <p>
          DNS, or the Domain Name System, is like the internet's phonebook. It
          translates human-friendly domain names, such as www.google.com, into
          machine-readable IP addresses, like 142.250.190.46. This process is
          essential because computers communicate using numerical IP addresses,
          but humans find it much easier to remember and use names.
        </p>

        <h3>How DNS Works</h3>
        <p>
          The DNS resolution process is a series of steps that a computer takes
          to find the correct IP address for a given domain name. Here's a
          breakdown of the key components and the process:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>DNS Resolver:</b>This is typically part of your internet
              service provider (ISP). It's the first stop in the DNS lookup
              process. When you type a domain name into your browser, your
              computer sends a request to the DNS resolver.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Root Name Servers:</b>If the DNS resolver doesn't have the IP
              address in its cache, it queries a root name server. There are 13
              logical root servers worldwide, and they manage the highest level
              of the DNS hierarchy. They don't know the specific IP address
              you're looking for, but they point the resolver to the correct
              Top-Level Domain (TLD) name server.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>TLD Name Servers: </b>These servers manage specific top-level
              domains like .com, .org, or .net. For example, a .com TLD name
              server would be queried for www.google.com. It then directs the
              resolver to the authoritative name server.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Authoritative Name Server:</b>This server holds the actual DNS
              records for a specific domain. It's the final stop in the
              resolution process and provides the DNS resolver with the IP
              address. The resolver then sends this IP address back to your
              computer, and your browser can connect to the website.

      <!-- Port number -->

      <div>
        <h2>Port Number:</h2>
        <p>
          Port numbers are numerical identifiers (0-65535) in computer
          networking that identify specific applications or services on a
          device. They work with IP addresses to direct network traffic to the
          correct service on a machine, with common ports assigned to standard
          applications like HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443).
        </p>

        <p>A port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>16-bit:</b>This means the number is stored using 16 binary
              digits (1s and 0s).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Unsigned:</b>This means it cannot be negative. The values are
              all positive.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Because it's a 16-bit number, the total number of possible ports is
          2^16, which equals 65,536.
        </p>

        <h3>The Practical Format: The Three Categories:</h3>
        <p>
          To prevent chaos, the internet authorities (IANA) have divided the
          65,536 available ports into three categories. This is the most
          practical format for you as a developer to understand.
        </p>

        <!-- well known ports -->
        <div>
          <h4>1:Well-Known Ports (Range: 0 - 1023)</h4>
          <p>
            These are the VIPs of the port world. They are reserved for the most
            common, fundamental, and standardized internet services.

              <p>
                <b>Privileges:</b>On most operating systems (like Linux and
                macOS), you need administrator (root or sudo) privileges to run
                a program that listens on these ports. This is a security
                measure to prevent rogue applications from impersonating
                standard services.

        <div>
          <h4>2. Registered Ports (Range: 1024 - 49151)</h4>
          <p>
            These ports are for specific applications or services that are not
            as universal as the "well-known" ones. Companies and developers can
            register a port for their software to avoid conflicts with other
            applications.
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Dynamic ports -->
        <div>
          <h4>3. Dynamic / Private / Ephemeral Ports (Range: 49152 - 65535)</h4>
          <p>
            When your web browser (the client) makes a request to a server
            (e.g., to google.com on port 443), your computer's operating system
            needs to assign a temporary source port for its side of the
            conversation. It grabs a random, unused port from this high-numbered
            range for the duration of that single connection.
